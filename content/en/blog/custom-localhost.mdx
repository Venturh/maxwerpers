A nice way to improve your developer workflow is to add a custom domain to your local development.
With this you will get a 'yourdomain'.localhost domain, which can help organizing your local development servers.
It is also possible to expose different ports, to run multiple servers at once or even always start the dev server on startup.

To archieve this, we will use docker and traefik as a reverse-proxy. If you haven´t setup docker yet, [follow the getting started guide from docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
You will also need docker.compose, if you don´t habe it already [from here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
After installing docker you are ready to go!

We will be using a NextJS app, but it should work with any framkework.
These will be the basic steps to set it up:

1. Update package.json development scripts.
2. Create a docker-compose.yml.
3. Setup traefik and the next-app in the docker-config.yml.
4. Your are done!

Let´s go:
We will use the script tag dev to run docker-compose, and web:dev to start the next dev server:

_package.json_

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "docker-compose up",
    "dev:next": "next dev -p 1337",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
```

_docker-compose-yml_

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.3
    command: --api.insecure=true --providers.docker
    #expose ports
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      # So that Traefik can listen to the Docker events
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

  next:
    image: node:14
    # export nextjs port, you can use any port on the right side
    ports:
      - '1337:1337'
    volumes:
      - .:/srv/web:rw
    working_dir: /srv/web
    # the package.json script to start the dev server
    command: yarn dev:next
    # if you have env variables you can define a .env file here.
    env_file:
      - ./.env
    # you can choose any prefix to for your domain.
    labels:
      - 'traefik.http.routers.frontend.rule=Host(`portfolio.localhost`)'
```

### Conclusion

I like the idea a lot to use custom domains, since it makes organizing a little bit simpler and it is simple to setup.
